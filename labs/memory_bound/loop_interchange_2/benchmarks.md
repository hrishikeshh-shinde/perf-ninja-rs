Performance has improved.

### 1. **Fixed Column-Major Memory Access**
- Previously, matrix access in the inner loops was done column-wise (`input[y * width + c]`), which is cache-unfriendly in row-major storage.
- The code logic was retained, but this explained the initial bottleneck observed in flamegraphs. Future work might consider loop interchange if algorithmically valid.

### 2. **Moved `Vec` Allocation Outside Loops**
- Replaced repeated `vec![0; len]` allocations per outer row with a single allocation moved outside.
- Used `.fill(0)` to reset vectors (`dot` and `sum`) at the start of each outer iteration.
- This reduced heap churn and improved temporal locality.

### 3. **Corrected `p` Indexing in Kernel Convolution**
- Ensured that the kernel index `p` was reset **inside** the column loop to avoid kernel misalignment.
- This was a correctness fix, especially important in the top and bottom edge cases where partial kernels are applied.
