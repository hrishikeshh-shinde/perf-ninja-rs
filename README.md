# My Solutions to Performance Ninja Labs (Rust)

This repository contains **my personal solutions** to the Performance Ninja labs, ported to Rust from the original C++ repository:  
üîó [Original Repo](https://github.com/dendibakh/perf-ninja)

I've been really enjoying these tasks ‚Äî they're challenging, rewarding, and teach you a lot about how modern CPUs actually behave. I forked the repo just to keep a personal copy and track my own progress and improvements. I had real fun solving these!

## Labs Completed So Far

These are grouped by category. I've implemented and benchmarked all of these locally:

### ‚úÖ Core Bound:

### ‚úÖ Memory Bound:
- Data Packing
- Loop Interchange 1
- Loop Interchange 2
- Loop Tiling
- Software Memory Prefetching

### ‚úÖ Bad Speculation:


### ‚úÖ Misc:
- Warmup

## How I Run & Test

I benchmark with `cargo bench` and validate correctness with `cargo test`.  
I've also tried using tools like `samply` and `pprof-rs` for deeper performance analysis.

## Final Thoughts

The labs are a fantastic way to go beyond ‚Äúwriting code that works‚Äù and start thinking about **how code runs**.  
The insights I‚Äôve gained are directly applicable to building high-performance systems in Rust and beyond.

Big thanks to [Denis Bakhvalov](https://easyperf.net) for the original project and [Graham King](https://github.com/grahamking) for the Rust port.

If you're working through these labs too ‚Äî let‚Äôs connect!
